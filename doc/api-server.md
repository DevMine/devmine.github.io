# API server

`devmine` is the API server. It provides a JSON RESTful API to provide
information computed by various DevMine sub-projects. It is also able to answer
queries to rank and filter developers according to some user queries. Say a user
wants to find a good Go developer with some experience in Java and functional
programming as well, `devmine` is able to provide an answer to that.
