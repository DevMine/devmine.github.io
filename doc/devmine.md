# DevMine

A set of projects, combined together, make DevMine possible. Each of them has
its own purpose and as such, the project is very modular.

Most of the projects are implemented in the [Go](http://golang.org/) programming
language. An early prototype as well as the first version of DevMine were
written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) but all of this code base is now
obsolete. DevMine uses [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) as its database
system and this component is essential to glue all sub-projects together.

Current implementation of the DevMine project consists of 7 sub-projects and
several language parsers:

 * [crawld][crawld]: is responsible for collecting metadata about developers
   as well as cloning source code repositories.
 * language parsers: are responsible for parsing source code and producing an
   abstract representation of it, in JSON.
 * [srctool][srctool]: is a tool to manage language parsers. It can install
   them and run them on source code.
 * [repotool][repotool]: aggregates source code repositories metadata from
   version control systems (Git, Mercurial, ...) and produces and abstract
   representation of it, in JSON.
 * [srcanlzr][srcanlzr]: analyzes source code, from the abstract
   representation produced by the various language parsers.
 * [features][features]: computes _features_ from all of the collected
   metadata and stores them into the database.
 * [API-server][api-server]: serves all data produced by the tools mentioned
   above in a for of a JSON RESTful API.
 * [web interface][web]: is a demo web interface that interacts with the
   API-server.

## Database schema

The PostgreSQL database is used by [crawld][crawld], [features][features] and
[api-server][api-server].
