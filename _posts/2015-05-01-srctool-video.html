Here is a short video that shows <a href="/doc/srctool"><code>srctool</code></a>
in action. This is the first one of a series of videos that demo the various
DevMine tools.
</p>
<p>
I suggest you watch it full screen for a better experience.

<p>
<a href="/doc/srctool"><code>srctool</code></a> is a command
line tool to manage source code parsers.
As such, it is able to install, delete or update parsers but moreover, it can
be used to parse projects sources by running the language parsers and merging
their output into one JSON.

<a href="/doc/srctool">documentation page</a>.
